# chess-bot-super
A chessbot learning from a masters games database.
Work in progress.

# Chess ML Engine

A chess engine built using supervised learning on master-level games, with plans to extend it using reinforcement learning.

## Project Overview
This project aims to create a chess AI capable of playing at approximately 1500-1800 ELO strength through:
- Supervised learning from master games
- Move evaluation using neural networks
- Search implementation


## Technologies
- Python 3.9+
- python-chess
- Tensorflow
- pandas/numpy

## Getting Started
(Instructions on how to set up will be added as the project develops)
